These settings allow a 3.4.113-RT build for the Nanopi Neo. The configs are based on armbian's work, and merely adapted for the buildroot system.

This was an initial test to see if I could get a realtime kernel built for the Neo. There are some issues with the legacy branch:
Overheating at idle
Larger power draw
Very strange kernel drivers
Larger kernel size and ~20 megs of RAM usage running on boot


Due to the overhead of modifying the I2S drivers to be useful to me, and having no documentation on how to do that, I've stopped developing for this branch.

Since the mainline kernel performs better with regards to heat and power draw, is being actively maintained, and compiles to a smaller size, I have chosen that for my needs.
