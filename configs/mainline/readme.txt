The FriendlyARM Nanopi NEO is a 4x4cmÂ² board with an Allwiner H3 SoC:
  - quad-core Cortex-A7 @1.2GHz
  - 256 or 512MiB of DDR
  - uSDCard as only storage option
  - 3x USB 2.0 host (one socket, two on expansion pin-holes)
  - 1x USB 2.0 OTG (also used as power source)
  - 10/100 ethernet MAC
  - GPIOs, SPI, I2c...

Confirmed working are USB OTG (legacy and configfs), ethernet (100M), and GPIO functions (via sysfs). 

Two cores have been reserved for running high priority tasks using isolcpus=2,3 in boot.cmd.

Bootdelay has been reduced to zero for faster boot times.

With S40network disabled in /etc/init.d, it boots in roughly 4 seconds. 

These config files create a working 4.11.9 PREEMPT RT kernel for the Nanopi Neo.



Improvements/TODO:

Test I2C, SPI
Enable FBTFT library from notro and test
Stress test USB OTG
Add cyclic RT test package
